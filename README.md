This project is a Node.js application written in TypeScript

that securely interacts with the Sunvoy API to orchestrate

a user login, retrieve user data as well as authenticated

user data, and writes that data to a JSON file.

Initialize a new Node.js project:

npm init -y


Install TypeScript and types for Node.js:

npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node

I installed the @types/node package for the purpose

of enabling early detection of errors related to

Node.js APIs through static type checking.


Initialize a TypeScript configuration file:

npx tsc --init


Remember that the TypeScript configuration file serves

as an instruction manual for the TypeScript compiler,

specifying how the project should be compiled and

processed.


Install node-fetch for fetch API support in Node.js:

npm install node-fetch@3


node-fetch@3 provides the fetch API for making HTTP

requests in a Node.js environment.


mkdir src data

The "data" folder is where data generated by the project's

scripts will be stored.

An example would be the users.json file where the fetched

user data is being saved.


I created the fetchUsers.ts file inside the src folder

with the intention of writing source code there that

will perform an API call and write the output file.

Compile the TypeScript source code by executing the

following in the project root directory which is the

directory where tsconfig.json is located:

npx tsc

In tsconfig.json, I included the subsequent line in

the compilerOptions, this way files generated as a

consequence of compilation will be outputted there:

"outDir": "./dist",


In tsconfig.json, but outside of compilerOptions,
I added the below two lines:

"include": ["src/**/*"],
"exclude": ["node_modules"]


"include": ["src/**/*"] tells the compiler to compile

all TypeScript files under src.

"exclude": ["node_modules"] tells the TypeScript compiler

not to compile any files inside the node_modules directory.


Execute the compiled script with:

node ./dist/fetchUsers.js


npm i node-fetch

npm i fetch-cookie

npm install jsdom

npm install --save-dev @types/jsdom

Install all dependencies:

npm install

To run the script:

npm run start
