Initialize a new Node.js project:

npm init -y


Install TypeScript and types for Node.js:

npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node

I installed the @types/node package for the purpose
of enabling early detection of errors related to
Node.js APIs through static type checking.


Initialize a TypeScript configuration file:

npx tsc --init


The TypeScript configuration file serves as an instruction
manual for the TypeScript compiler, specifying how the
project should be compiled and processed.


Install node-fetch for fetch API support in Node.js:

npm install node-fetch@3


node-fetch@3 provides the fetch API for making HTTP
requests in a Node.js environment.


mkdir src data

The "data" folder is where data generated by the project's
scripts will be stored.

An example would be the users.json file where the fetched
user data is being saved.


I created the fetchUsers.ts file inside the src folder
with the intention of writing source code there that
will perform an API call and write the output file.

Compile the TypeScript source code by executing the
following in the project root directory which is the
directory where tsconfig.json is located:

npx tsc

In tsconfig.json, I included the subsequent line in
the compilerOptions, this way files generated as a
consequence of compilation will be outputted there:

"outDir": "./dist",


In tsconfig.json, but outside of compilerOptions,
I added the below two lines:

"include": ["src/**/*"],
"exclude": ["node_modules"]


"include": ["src/**/*"] tells the compiler to compile
all TypeScript files under src.

"exclude": ["node_modules"] tells the TypeScript compiler
not to compile any files inside the node_modules directory.


Execute the compiled script with:

node ./dist/fetchUsers.js


Install the Axios HTTP client library to emulate
internal API calls:

npm install axios
