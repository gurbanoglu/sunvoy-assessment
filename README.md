This project is a Node.js application written in TypeScript
that securely interacts with the Sunvoy API to orchestrate
a user login, retrieve user data as well as authenticated
user data, and writes that data to a JSON file.

Initialize a new Node.js project:

npm init -y


Install TypeScript and types for Node.js:

npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node

I installed the @types/node package for the purpose

of enabling early detection of errors related to

Node.js APIs through static type checking.


Initialize a TypeScript configuration file: <br>
npx tsc --init
<br>
Remember that the TypeScript configuration file <br>
serves as an instruction manual for the TypeScript <br>
compiler, specifying how the project should be <br>
compiled and processed.<br>

Install node-fetch for fetch API support in Node.js:
npm install node-fetch@3


node-fetch@3 provides the fetch API for making HTTP

requests in a Node.js environment.


mkdir src data

The "data" folder is where data generated by the <br>
project's scripts will be stored.

An example would be the users.json file where the <br>
fetched user data is being saved.


I created the fetchUsers.ts file inside the src folder <br>
with the intention of writing source code there that <br>
will perform an API call and write the output file.

Compile the TypeScript source code by executing the <br>
following in the project root directory which is the <br>
directory where tsconfig.json is located: <br>
npx tsc

In tsconfig.json, I included the subsequent line in <br>
the compilerOptions, this way files generated as a <br>
consequence of compilation will be outputted there: <br>
"outDir": "./dist",

In tsconfig.json, but outside of compilerOptions,
I added the below two lines:

"include": ["src/**/*"],<br>
"exclude": ["node_modules"]


"include": ["src/**/*"] tells the compiler to compile
<br> all TypeScript files under src.

"exclude": ["node_modules"] tells the TypeScript
compiler<br>not to compile any files inside the
node_modules directory.

Install node-fetch, fetch-cookie, and jsdom:
npm i node-fetch

npm i fetch-cookie

npm install jsdom

npm install --save-dev @types/jsdom
<br>
Install all dependencies:<br>
npm install
<br>
To run the script:<br>
npm run start
